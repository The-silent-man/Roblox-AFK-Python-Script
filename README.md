# Roblox-AFK-Python-Script


An AFK Script that uses the keyboard library to make timed executions of keyboard keys. so that you aren't kicked in the 20+ min time limit for being afk
It's only good if you're fully AFK and on the roblox screen, you can't ALT+TAB away from it or you're cooked.

Not meant for any specific game only to just keep you in the server while you're away
