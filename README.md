# Roblox-AFK-Python-Script


A very simple AFK Script that uses the keyboard and time library to make timed executions of keyboard keys.
It's only good if you're fully AFK and on the roblox screen, you can't ALT+TAB away from it or you're cooked.

Not meant for any specific game only to just keep you in the server while you're away

# How to use it

First you gotta install the latest version of python to your computer.

Next you install the Keyboard Library keyboard with this command here "python -m pip keyboard"
(assuming you've installed Python 3.14) 

After that install the file afk.py or just copy the contents and put it in your own python file 

Run the file and then tab back into Roblox

Now you're able to walk away from your computer for more than 20+ min and still be in the server.
