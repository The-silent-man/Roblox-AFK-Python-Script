# Roblox-AFK-Python-Script


A very simple AFK Script that uses the keyboard library to make timed executions of keyboard keys.
It's only good if you're fully AFK and on the roblox screen, you can't ALT+TAB away from it or you're cooked.

Not meant for any specific game only to just keep you in the server while you're away
